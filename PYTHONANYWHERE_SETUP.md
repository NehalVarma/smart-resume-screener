## üìã Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Create PythonAnywhere Account
1. Go to: https://www.pythonanywhere.com/registration/register/beginner/
2. Sign up for the **FREE Beginner account**
3. Verify your email

### Step 2: Open Bash Console
1. After login, go to the **Dashboard**
2. Click on **"Consoles"** tab
3. Click **"Bash"** to open a new console

### Step 3: Clone Your Repository
In the Bash console, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NehalVarma/smart-resume-screener.git
cd smart-resume-screener
```

### Step 4: Create Virtual Environment
```bash
mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.10 myenv
```

### Step 5: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 6: Create Web App
1. Go to **"Web"** tab in PythonAnywhere dashboard
2. Click **"Add a new web app"**
3. Choose **"Manual configuration"** (not "Flask")
4. Select **Python 3.10**

### Step 7: Configure WSGI File
1. In the **Web** tab, click on the **WSGI configuration file** link
2. Delete all the default content
3. Add this code:

```python
import sys
import os

# Add your project directory to the sys.path
project_home = '/home/YOURUSERNAME/smart-resume-screener'
if project_home not in sys.path:
    sys.path = [project_home] + sys.path

# Set environment variables
os.environ['PYTHONUNBUFFERED'] = '1'

# Import Flask app
from app import app as application
```

**IMPORTANT:** Replace `YOURUSERNAME` with your actual PythonAnywhere username!

### Step 8: Configure Virtual Environment
1. In the **Web** tab, scroll to **"Virtualenv"** section
2. Enter the path: `/home/YOURUSERNAME/.virtualenvs/myenv`
3. Replace `YOURUSENAME` with your actual username

### Step 9: Set Working Directory
1. In the **Web** tab, find **"Code"** section
2. Set **Source code** to: `/home/YOURUSERNAME/smart-resume-screener`
3. Set **Working directory** to: `/home/YOURUSERNAME/smart-resume-screener`

### Step 10: Create Uploads Directory
Back in the Bash console:
```bash
cd ~/smart-resume-screener
mkdir -p uploads/resumes
chmod 755 uploads
chmod 755 uploads/resumes
```

### Step 11: Reload Web App
1. Go back to **Web** tab
2. Click the big green **"Reload"** button at the top

### Step 12: Test Your App! üéâ
Your app is now live at: `https://YOURUSERNAME.pythonanywhere.com`
