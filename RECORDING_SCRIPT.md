## 📝 ALTERNATIVE SHORTER VERSION (2 minutes)

If you want to keep it under 2 minutes, **SKIP Scene 5** (code walkthrough) and go straight from results to outro.

---

## 🎯 KEY PHRASES TO INCLUDE

Make sure you say these somewhere in your demo:

✅ **"AI-powered"** or **"LLM-based"**
✅ **"Semantic analysis"** (not just keyword matching)
✅ **"Structured data extraction"**
✅ **"Objective scoring"**
✅ **"Detailed justifications"**
✅ **"RESTful API"**
✅ **"Flask backend"**
✅ **"Prompt engineering"**

---

## 🎤 VOICE & PACING TIPS

### Energy Level:
- Start: **Medium-high** (enthusiastic but professional)
- Middle: **Steady** (explaining clearly)
- End: **Confident** (strong close)

### Pacing:
- **Slow down** when showing scores and justifications
- **Pause** briefly after important points
- **Speed up slightly** during transitions

### Tone:
- Professional but friendly
- Confident (you built this!)
- Avoid: "Um," "uh," "like," "so," "actually"

## 🚨 COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### Issue 1: Upload takes too long
**SAY:** "The AI is processing the resumes in real-time, extracting skills, experience, and education from each document."

### Issue 2: Matching takes too long
**SAY:** "The language model is performing semantic analysis, comparing each candidate against the job requirements."

### Issue 3: You make a mistake
**DON'T:** Apologize or say "oops"
**DO:** Just continue naturally or pause recording and restart

### Issue 4: You forget what to say
**DO:** Take a breath, look at results, describe what you see naturally
